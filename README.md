# Open Science Prize
OpenEXP: An open-source desktop app for collecting behavioral and physiological data

## Executive Summary
OpenEXP is an open-source and open-science platform for crowdsourcing, collaborating, and sharing behavioral and EEG experiments related to the brain. The primary aims of the project are to 1) provide an intuitive and robust application for designing and executing EEG and behavioral experiments, 2) to provide real-time visualization of EEG data 3) to provide state-of-the-art analytics and 4) to provide a web- based, open-access repository for experiments and data so that scientific discoveries can be shared and collaborated on by researchers and community members alike.
OpenEXP builds upon an enormous number of open-source scientific software packages, bringing them all together into a single application based on clean and robust modern web technologies. OpenEXP will provide the first ever free and open-access marketplace for cognitive research experiments, interactive tutorials, and research results. These resources will be an invaluable addition to research, and a major advancement toward an open science future. Furthermore, because the application is web-based, researchers around the world will be able to seamlessly share and collaborate on experiments.
We are absolutely dedicated to the open-science mission, and feel that the proposed software truly has the potential change the face of cognitive research as we know it. By allowing researchers, students, and international community members to collaborate on difficult problems related to the brain, we will learn exponentially more together as a community than we would if we perform our research in isolation. Working together with a team of research scientists, hardware and software engineers, web developers and designers, we are confident that our team has the experience and the technical expertise to design a comprehensive open science platform built upon a strong foundation of open-source technology. We hope that this application will provide tools to combat the problems of reproducibility in scientific experiments, promote collaboration among geographically distributed researchers, and to foster communication of psychological science to the general public.
